# TMMX: The Mad Murderer X Trading Tool

TMMX is an easy-to-use, free, and fast way to trade in The Mad Murderer X!

Developed by Spomge, also known as Vanished, this tool is a work in progress and will be periodically updated. I do not receive any payment for this project. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to ping me in the MAD STUDIO Discord (@vanishedvendetta)!
